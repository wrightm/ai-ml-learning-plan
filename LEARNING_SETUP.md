# Learning-Focused Setup ✅

This repository is now configured for **learning AI & ML**, not building production systems.

## What This Repo Is For

✅ **Learning** - Jupyter notebooks, experiments, notes  
✅ **Exploring** - Try ideas, make mistakes, iterate  
✅ **Documenting** - Markdown notes, visualizations  
✅ **Building intuition** - Code from scratch, understand deeply  

❌ **NOT for** - Production code, unit tests, CI/CD, strict code quality  

## Quick Start (2 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Setup environment
python3.11 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Verify
python verify_setup.py

# 4. Start learning!
jupyter lab
```

## What's Installed

**Core Learning Tools** (~40 packages)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Lab (interactive notebooks)
- PyTorch (deep learning)
- Weights & Biases (experiment tracking)
- LangChain, OpenAI (LLMs and agents)
- implicit, lightfm (recommender systems)
- FAISS (vector search)

**What's NOT Installed** (intentionally removed)
- ❌ pytest, pytest-cov (testing frameworks)
- ❌ black, ruff, mypy (code formatters/linters)
- ❌ pre-commit hooks (automatic code checks)
- ❌ Docker, Kubernetes (deployment tools)

```

## Daily Learning Workflow

```bash
# Morning (start work)
source .venv/bin/activate
jupyter lab

# During work
# - Open/create notebooks in journal/weeks/WEEK_XX/
# - Code, experiment, visualize
# - Take notes in markdown cells or README.md

# End of session
# - Save notebooks (auto-saved)
# - git add . && git commit -m "Week X progress"
# - git push
```

## Simple Commands

```bash
make help       # Show available commands
make install    # Install dependencies
make verify     # Check setup
make lab        # Start Jupyter Lab
make clean      # Remove cache files
```

## What to Focus On

### ✅ Do This
- **Understand deeply** - Why does this work?
- **Code from scratch** - Don't just use libraries
- **Visualize everything** - Build intuition
- **Take notes** - Document learnings
- **Experiment freely** - Try variations
- **Review regularly** - Spaced repetition

### ❌ Don't Worry About
- Writing tests - focus on understanding
- Code formatting - clarity over style
- Production patterns - learn first, optimize later
- Perfect code - messy notebooks are fine!
- Type hints - not needed for learning
- Documentation strings - comments are enough

## Learning Tools

### Jupyter Lab
- Interactive development
- Inline visualizations
- Mix code and markdown
- Experiment quickly

### Git (Simple Usage)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Week 1 complete"
git push
```
Just track progress, don't overthink it.

### Markdown Files
Use for notes, not docs:
- README.md - week overview
- reading_list.md - papers
- Quick notes inline

## File Types You'll Create

### Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)
- Main learning tool
- Mix code, output, notes
- One per major concept
- Save often!

### Python Scripts (`.py`)
- Reusable utilities
- Helper functions
- Keep it simple

### Markdown (`.md`)
- Week summaries
- Reading notes
- Quick insights

## Progress Tracking

**Simple Method**: Check boxes in README.md
```markdown
- [x] W1 — Vectors & Matrices refresher
- [ ] W2 — Probability & Stats I
```

**Optional**: GitHub Actions will auto-update badge (if `.github/` exists)

## Getting Help

1. **Setup issues**: Read `SETUP.md`
2. **Commands**: Check `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
3. **Concepts**: Google, documentation, papers
4. **Code errors**: Read error messages carefully
5. **Stuck**: Simplify, start smaller

## Success Metrics

You're doing it right if:
- ✅ You understand what you're coding
- ✅ You can explain concepts simply
- ✅ You're building intuition
- ✅ You're consistent (1 hr/day)
- ✅ You're enjoying the process

You're overthinking if:
- ❌ Spending time on code style
- ❌ Writing comprehensive tests
- ❌ Optimizing performance
- ❌ Creating perfect documentation
- ❌ Worrying about best practices

## Key Principle

> **Learning beats optimization**
> 
> Code from scratch, understand deeply, move forward.
> Don't optimize until you understand.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Verify setup: `python verify_setup.py`
2. 📚 Read: `README.md` (the 52-week plan)
3. 🚀 Start: `jupyter lab`
4. 📝 Open: `journal/weeks/WEEK_01/W01_PCA_via_SVD.ipynb`
5. 🎯 Learn: Follow the weekly rhythm

**Happy Learning! 🚀**

*Focus on understanding, not perfection.*
