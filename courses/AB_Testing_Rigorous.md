# AB Testing Rigorous

**Why:** Experiment design, power/MDE, variance reduction.

**Suggested slot:** Weeks 29–30

## What to do
- [ ] Pre-register hypotheses
- [ ] Compute power/MDE & runtime
- [ ] Post-analysis with CUPED (if relevant)

## Deliverable
- Short README/notebook proving outcomes.

## Mapping to the 52-Week Plan
- **Weeks:** 29–30  
- **Phase:** Phase 3 — Recommendation Systems
