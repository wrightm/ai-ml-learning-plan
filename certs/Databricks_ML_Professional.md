# Databricks ML – Professional (4-Week Sprint)

**Outcome:** Lakehouse-native ML: Delta/Unity Catalog + MLflow + Feature Store + Serving/Monitoring.  
**When:** Optional overlay **Weeks 45–48**.

## Weekly plan
- [ ] **W1 — Lakehouse & Governance**: Delta (OPTIMIZE/VACUUM/Z-order), Unity Catalog, clusters/jobs & cost. **Deliverable:** dataset → Delta + perf notes.
- [ ] **W2 — MLflow & Registry**: tracking, artifacts, model stages, reports. **Deliverable:** comparison report attached to PR.
- [ ] **W3 — Features & Pipelines**: DLT, Feature Store (train/serve parity), inference tables. **Deliverable:** feature pipeline feeding model.
- [ ] **W4 — Serving & Monitoring**: Model Serving, AB/shadow, drift monitors, rollback. **Deliverable:** served model + drift thresholds & rollback.

## Hands-on checklist
- [ ] MLflow model: staging → prod with approval  
- [ ] DLT + Feature Store used both offline & online  
- [ ] Inference tables powering monitoring dashboards

## Mapping to the 52-Week Plan
- **Weeks:** 45–48  
- **Phase:** Phase 5 — Integrating Agents + Recsys  
- **Dependencies:** AWS ML Specialty (or equivalent prod experience) recommended  
- **Feeds into:** Phase 5 hardening & Capstone deployment
