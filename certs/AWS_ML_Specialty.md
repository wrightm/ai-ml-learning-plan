# AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty (6-Week Sprint)

**Outcome:** End-to-end ML on AWS (data → training → deploy → MLOps → governance).  
**When:** Overlay Weeks **37–42** or any contiguous 6 weeks.

## Weekly plan
- [ ] **W1 — Data & Storage**: S3 layout (partitioning/lifecycle/classes), Glue/Athena, KMS/IAM, VPC endpoints/PrivateLink, Feature Store basics. **Deliverable:** ETL to S3 + Athena query + architecture sketch.
- [ ] **W2 — EDA & Modeling**: leakage, CV, imbalance, calibration, ranking metrics & slices. **Deliverable:** metrics harness + EDA notebook.
- [ ] **W3 — Training**: SageMaker built-ins, HPO, spot/distributed, Debugger/Profiler, custom containers (minimal). **Deliverable:** trained & registered model.
- [ ] **W4 — MLOps**: Pipelines, Model Registry, Model Monitor, Clarify; shadow/canary/blue-green; CI/CD. **Deliverable:** pipeline that promotes on metric threshold.
- [ ] **W5 — GenAI (Bedrock)**: Knowledge Bases, Agents, Guardrails; retrieval quality & eval. **Deliverable:** tiny Bedrock RAG/tool demo + eval note.
- [ ] **W6 — Exam Readiness**: 2 timed tests; error log; flashcards; weak-area drills. **Deliverable:** exam-style Q&A doc + three reference designs.

## Hands-on checklist
- [ ] Private networking (VPC endpoints/PrivateLink) + KMS in design  
- [ ] Real-time + batch endpoints with Monitor/alarms  
- [ ] Clarify report with mitigation notes  
- [ ] Pipeline → Registry → Deploy → Rollback path

## Mapping to the 52-Week Plan
- **Weeks:** 37–42  
- **Phase:** Phase 4 — Agentic AI  
- **Dependencies:** Phases 1–3 complete (foundations, DL, recsys)  
- **Feeds into:** Mini-Capstone #2 and Phase 5 hardening
